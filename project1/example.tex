\section{Example project}
This is an example project!!
\begin{verbatim}
this is a verbatim block
   yes, it is!!
\end{verbatim}
I'm learning to plot in python!

\subsection{some basic examples!}
\subsubsection{example plot}\label{sec:examplePlot1}
Here's an example plot!
\o[7/8/25 20:08 (JF)]{this is what I observe about the plot there is no space before the debug block}
\begin{err}
    \o[7/8/25 20:06 (JF)]{I had some problems making the plot}
    then I do some stuff to fix the problems
    \textit{in italics!}
    \o[7/8/25 20:08 (JF)]{here are notes about the specific solution}
\end{err}
\o[11/27 16:51]{Make sure there is no space betwen the err and obs here!!}
\o[2/15/24 11:55]{another observation}
\o{$\checkmark$}

\begin{err}
    Make sure that this line lines up with the following lines.

    Another step for debugging.

    And another step for debugging -- make sure there is no space between this and closing tag.
\end{err}

\begin{python}[on]
from pylab import *
from pyspecdata import *
with figlist_var() as fl:
    fl.next('this is a plot')
    fl.plot(r_[0:10])
\end{python}
\par
continue

\begin{err}
    \o[7/9/25 11:04 (JF)]{maybe I'm having issues continuing!}
    resolve those issues!
    \o[7/9/25 11:04 (JF)]{I did some stuff, but it was insufficient}
    continue debugging

\end{err}
