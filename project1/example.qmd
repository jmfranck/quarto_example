<err>
  <obs time="7/8/25 20:06" author="JF">I had some problems making the plot</obs>

  <obs time="7/8/25 20:08" author="JF">here are notes about the specific solution</obs>
</err>
<obs time="11/27 16:51">Make sure there is no space betwen the err and obs here!!</obs>

  Make sure that this line lines up with the following lines.

  Another step for debugging.

  And another step for debugging -- make sure there is no space between this and closing tag.

```{python}
from pylab import *
from pyspecdata import *
with figlist_var() as fl:
    fl.next('this is a plot')
    fl.plot(r_[0:10])
```

continue

<err>
  <obs time="7/9/25 11:04" author="JF">maybe I'm having issues continuing!</obs>
  resolve those issues!
  <obs time="7/9/25 11:04" author="JF">I did some stuff, but it was insufficient</obs>
  continue debugging

</err>
